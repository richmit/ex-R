This collection of example R code is intended more as a FAQ than as a
general learning resource. That is to say that each source file
answers, by way of example code, some question I frequently receive.

You can read a bit more about these examples on my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/R.html).

Have fun!
